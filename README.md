The main code results can be run by having the data and python files from this repository and running adaboost_tests.py, lr_tests.py, svm_tests.py in Python from the command line to obtain corresponding results. Runtime can be reduced by omitting large weight values or just simply skipping over the cross-validation portion and training and testing models for weight values of choice, as it may take a considerably long time.  

Some additional stuff such as use of the Million Song dataset can be found in the notebook files, although the data is too large to be uploaded to Github it is cited in the project report. Some results and extra PRC plots can be found in the notebook output, although those are less organized.
